## About the FENGSim project

The FENGSim project is an open-source project for Digital Twins. Without a large team and a lot of money, it is normally difficult and near impossible to develop a digital twin system like Siemens TeamCenter, Dassault 3D Experience and Ansys WorkBench etc. But weâ€™ve proven that open-source software is a good solution to this and it brings its products directly to industrial sector. If you want to develop your own digital twin software, join the FENGSim project!

**About Digital Twin**

There are many definitions and explanations for the digital twin and they make people very confused. We give our understanding and make the idea of the digital twin very simple.

- Given the cost and time in industrial production, it would be infeasible for manufacturers to complete the comprehensive and extreme assessment of their products, especially for complex systems like an aircraft. Therefore, the product should be optimized throughout the whole life cycle. 
- The manufacturers mainly concentrate on their designing and manufacturing processes and usually do not do MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) by themselves. The users or the third party will do MRO following the instructions from the manufacturers. Since the manufacturers do not track the use of their products, they will normally just provide conservative instructions. So, MRO can be a big cost for users and it will generally affect the performance of the products.
- Manufacturing is a very complicated process. Mismatching between products and their designs, whether in a small or large scale, will severely undermine their future performance. We thus have to optimize the manufacturing processes, in the meantime taking into account the effect of manufacturing techniques on the evaluation of product performance. 

The old product optimization is mainly done in the research & development stage and it is really difficult and very slow to considers the above problems. We need 500 years to Mars !!!

The followings are the core technologies used in Digital Twins:

- CAD, CAE, CAM and CAI,
- the coupling of system simulation and physical field simulation,
- Manufacturing Simulation,
- the coupling of CAX and artificial intelligence,
- geometrical and physical sensors,
- immersive interaction,
- edge computing.
